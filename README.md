## Introduction
For a soccer club, it is very important to consider the transfers of players during summers and winters. Player transfers will produce a great impact on both the loyalty of players in a team and the development of leagues and clubs.

The purpose of this analysis is to discover if there is any transfer preference among these clubs and leagues, which means a league or soccer club might be more willing to do business with some specific clubs or leagues. Social network analysis methods can offer some approaches, so this project is going to use them to examine the networks and to understand the hidden pattern behind it.

## Conclusion
After analyzing the european soccer database by social network analysis methods used above, we can clearly recognize the transfer communities. In this process, we can also find that not each league becomes a community, some communities are made up of two european leagues because of the intensive player transfers between them. For example, Spain LIGA BBVA and Portugal Liga ZON Sagres build up a community,The Iberian Peninsula. Spain and Portugal are geographically close and it reflects there might be a proximity principle for soccer player transfers.

What’s more, there is one or two “stepping stone” in most leagues, such as West Ham United from England Premier League and Sevilla FC from Spain LIGA BBVA. Although this kind of clubs might not be the strongest clubs in their leagues, they can act as a middle point of many clubs and has its importance in the European soccer. A soccer player is willing to join these clubs to gain more attention or reputation and that makes them more likely to join some top clubs in the future. This is the reason for the clubs’ high betweenness.

According to the result from CUG test and QAP test, the assortativities of our networks differ from random networks. It proves that the factor of leagues does affect the transactions of the soccer players.

For the limits of our analysis, we don’t have time to explore how the transactions relate with the ranking of each club, how the transactions change over time, how the transfer communities change over time and what if we take transaction fee into account how the network structure will change. There are so many attributes we haven’t used. We hope we can get a chance to make it better in the future.
